## Types

### D3Graph

```ts
declare type D3Graph = {
  nodes: Array<{
    id: string;
  }>;
  links: Array<{
    source: string;
    target: string;
  }>;
};
```

A representation a graph convenient for using with [D3.js force-directed graphs](https://github.com/d3/d3-force).

### Edge

```ts
declare type Edge = [string, string];
```

### Graph

```ts
declare type Graph = {
  [u: string]: {
    [v: string]: number;
  };
};
```

This is the main data structure used by graph-fns to represent a _graph_. It is an [adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix) where each number in the matrix describes the edge from vertex `u` to vertex `v`. By default, a value of `1` is used to indicate there is a edge between the two vertices, but any value other than `0` can be used to signify the presence of an edge (typically used to describe a weighted graph).

## Functions

### addEdge

```ts
declare const addEdge: (graph: Graph, [u, v]: Edge) => Graph;
```

Adds a new edge to the graph from vertex `u` to vertex `v`.

**Note**: `addEdge(graph, edge)` is equivalent to `setEdge(graph, edge, 1)`.

Also see:

- [removeEdge](#removeEdge)
- [getEdge](#getEdge)
- [setEdge](#setEdge)

### addVertex

```ts
declare const addVertex: (graph: Graph, vertex: string) => Graph;
```

Adds a new vertex to the graph. The new vertex will not have any edges connecting it to existing vertices in the graph.

**Note**: If the vertex already exists the graph will be returned unmodified.

Also see:

- [removeVertex](#removeVertex)

### ancestors

```ts
declare const ancestors: (graph: Graph, vertex: string) => Set<string>;
```

Given a [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph), returns all ancestors of the given vertex (i.e. vertices from which there is a directed path to the given vertex).

**Note**: If the given graph contains cycles (checked with [isCyclic](#isCyclic)), an error will be thrown.

Also see:

- [descendants](#descendants)

### children

```ts
declare const children: (graph: Graph, vertex: string) => Set<string>;
```

Returns all the vertices that are children of the given vertex (i.e. there is an edge starting at the given vertex going to the child vertex).

**Note**: If there is an edge that both starts and ends at the given vertex, it will be considered a child of itself and included in the result.

Also see:

- [parents](#parents)

### clone

```ts
declare const clone: (graph: Graph) => Graph;
```

Creates a copy of the graph.

### create

```ts
declare const create: (size?: number, id?: (i: number) => string) => Graph;
```

Creates a new graph. The new graph can be seeded with an optional number of vertices, but it will not contain any edges.

The `size` argument defines how many vertices with which to seed the graph. Additional vertices can be added using [addVertex](#addVertex), but it is more efficient to create them upfront when possible.

The `id` function can be provided to specify the identity of each vertex. The `i` argument passed is a unique monotonically increasing integer for each vertex being created and by default it will simply be converted to a string (`(i) => i.toString(10)`) resulting in the sequence `"0"`, `"1"`, `"2"` etc.

To create a graph using existing ID's you can use a pattern like this:

```js
const users = [
  { id: "412", name: "Jane" },
  { id: "34", name: "Kate" },
  { id: "526", name: "Mike" },
  { id: "155", name: "Tony" },
];

const graph = create(users.length, (i) => users[i].id);
```

### degree

```ts
declare const degree: (graph: Graph, vertex: string, weighted?: boolean) => number;
```

Returns the [degree](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(graph_theory)>) for the given vertex.

By default `weighted` is `false`, if set to `true` the result will be the sum of the edge weights (which could be zero or a negative value).

Also see:

- [indegree](#indegree)
- [outdegree](#outdegree)

### descendants

```ts
declare const descendants: (graph: Graph, vertex: string) => Set<string>;
```

Given a [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph), returns all descendants of the given vertex (i.e. vertices to which there is a directed path from the given vertex).

**Note**: If the given graph contains cycles (checked with [isCyclic](#isCyclic)), an error will be thrown.

Also see:

- [ancestors](#ancestors)

### edges

```ts
declare const edges: (graph: Graph) => Set<Edge>;
```

Returns all the edges in the graph (i.e. any edge with a value other than `0`).

### fromD3

```ts
declare const fromD3: (graph: D3Graph) => Graph;
```

Converts a graph from a [D3Graph](#D3Graph) representation into a [Graph](#Graph) representation.

When the D3Graph contains multiple links between two nodes the resulting graph will have inflated edge weights to reflect that.

```js
const graph = fromD3({
  nodes: [{ id: "A" }, { id: "B" }, { id: "C" }],
  links: [
    { source: "A", target: "B" },
    { source: "A", target: "C" },
    { source: "A", target: "C" },
  ],
});
//=> Graph { A -> B, A -> C }

getEdge(["A", "B"]);
//=> 1
getEdge(["A", "C"]);
//=> 2
```

**Note**: Any extraneous data associated with nodes or links in the D3Graph representation will be ignored.

Also see:

- [toD3](#toD3)

### getEdge

```ts
declare const getEdge: (graph: Graph, [u, v]: Edge) => number;
```

Get the weight of the given edge.

Also see:

- [addEdge](#addEdge)
- [removeEdge](#removeEdge)
- [setEdge](#setEdge)

### indegree

```ts
declare const indegree: (graph: Graph, vertex: string, weighted?: boolean) => number;
```

Returns the [indegree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indegree) for the given vertex.

By default `weighted` is `false`, if set to `true` the result will be the sum of the edge weights (which could be zero or a negative value).

Also see:

- [degree](#degree)
- [outdegree](#outdegree)

### isCyclic

```ts
declare const isCyclic: (graph: Graph) => boolean;
```

Returns `true` if the graph provided contains any [cycles](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_(graph_theory)>) (including "loops" â€” when an edge that starts and ends at the same vertex), otherwise returns `false`.

### order

```ts
declare const order: (graph: Graph) => number;
```

Returns the number of vertices in the graph.

### outdegree

```ts
declare const outdegree: (graph: Graph, vertex: string, weighted?: boolean) => number;
```

Returns the [outdegree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outdegree) for the given vertex.

By default `weighted` is `false`, if set to `true` the result will be the sum of the edge weights (which could be zero or a negative value).

Also see:

- [degree](#degree)
- [indegree](#indegree)

### parents

```ts
declare const parents: (graph: Graph, vertex: string) => Set<string>;
```

Returns all the vertices that are parents of the given vertex (i.e. there is an edge starting at the parent vertex going to the given vertex).

**Note**: If there is an edge that both starts and ends at the given vertex, it will be considered a parent of itself and included in the result.

Also see:

- [children](#children)

### removeEdge

```ts
declare const removeEdge: (graph: Graph, edge: Edge) => Graph;
```

Removes an edge from a graph.

**Note**: `removeEdge(graph, edge)` is equivalent to `setEdge(graph, edge, 0)`.

Also see:

- [addEdge](#addEdge)
- [getEdge](#getEdge)
- [setEdge](#setEdge)

### removeVertex

```ts
declare const removeVertex: (graph: Graph, vertex: string) => Graph;
```

Removes a vertex from a graph.

Also see:

- [addVertex](#addVertex)

### setEdge

```ts
declare const setEdge: (graph: Graph, [u, v]: Edge, weight: number) => Graph;
```

Set the weight of the given edge.

Also see:

- [addEdge](#addEdge)
- [getEdge](#getEdge)
- [removeEdge](#removeEdge)

### size

```ts
declare const size: (graph: Graph) => number;
```

Returns the number of edges in the graph.

### toD3

```ts
declare const toD3: (graph: Graph) => D3Graph;
```

Converts a graph from a [Graph](#Graph) representation into a [D3Graph](#D3Graph) representation.

Edges with a weight greater than 2 will result in multiple links being generated in the D3Graph.

```js
let graph = create(3, (i) => String.fromCharCode(65 + i));
//=> Graph { A, B, C }

graph = setEdge(graph, ["A", "B"], 1);
//=> Graph { A -> B, C }

graph = setEdge(graph, ["A", "C"], 2);
//=> Graph { A -> B, A -> C }

toD3(graph);
//=> {
//     nodes: [{ id: "A" }, { id: "B" }, { id: "C" }],
//     links: [
//       { source: "A", target: "B" },
//       { source: "A", target: "C" },
//       { source: "A", target: "C" },
//     ],
//   }
```

Also see:

- [fromD3](#fromD3)

### topologicalSort

```ts
declare const topologicalSort: (graph: Graph) => Array<string>;
```

Given a [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph), returns an array of the graph's vertices sorted using a [topological sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting).

**Note**: If the given graph contains cycles (checked with [isCyclic](#isCyclic)), an error will be thrown.

### transpose

```ts
declare const transpose: (graph: Graph) => Graph;
```

Flips the orientation of all edges in a directed graph.

```js
let graph = create(3, (i) => String.fromCharCode(65 + i));
//=> Graph { A, B, C }

graph = addEdge(graph, ["A", "B"]);
//=> Graph { A -> B, C }

graph = addEdge(graph, ["B", "C"]);
//=> Graph { A -> B, B -> C }

transpose(graph);
//=> Graph { B -> A, C -> B }
```

### vertices

```ts
declare const vertices: (graph: Graph) => Set<string>;
```
